## **Introduction**

**_When you play a game, do you ever feel like this game is too repetitive and easy? Maybe the game is predictable in almost every single stage? If the answer is YES, then i'd like to introduce you to Roguelike_**

Roguelike is a game genre focused on perseverance and mastery, bringing a new gameplay and a fresh experience each time the player dies and try again, from the very beginning stage to the ultimate final boss. Almost every Roguelike game has much content for the player to discover, and at the first few hours of game, it's sure to be difficult.

All your attempts, however, are in risk of a permanent death.

## **About RogueRift**

RogueRift it's a web application for buying games in the Roguelike genre

With Roguelike being introduced to you, you may want to have a look at its extensive catalogue. Take your time and prepare to retry.

**Features**

---

-   **Game Showcase** → The products are displayed in card format, with all the information the buyer needs.

-   **Cart** → The products choosed by the buyer will be added to the cart at the right of the screen. The buyer can view the total cost of all products in the cart.

-   **Search Bar** → The buyer may want to search a product by himself, using the search bar above the cart section.

-   **Tag Filter** → The buyer can search games by their categories (or tags), using the 'Categorias' button and then choosing one tag option.

**Development**

---

-   This application was made using vanilla Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.

-   It was also made at the Kenzie Academy Brasil's Web Development Training, in the first of six modules.

-   This app has another version, developed using vanilla Javascript with OOP and a mini JSON static database, in addition to SASS as alternative to CSS, although it is outdated and bugged. [Link to the repo](https://github.com/Buraio/JS-GameEcommercePage)

-   It was one of my first functional simple applications, using the first Javascript commands and logics, it was then refactored using advanced commands, in a more organized filesystem.

## **Installation**

You only need to clone this repository and start a live server with the index.html and that's it.

## **To-Do**

If this project does not turn into a more complex application, it will have the following features in the future

-   **Light-Dark system** → At the moment the app is full Dark mode, so it's interesting to bring the light theme for those who like it.

-   **Multiple products** → The buyer can only take one of the same product in the cart, so there should be a way to add more.

-   **Remove from cart button** → When the buyer clicks on the 'Adicionar ao carrinho', the button should turn its description to 'Remover do carrinho', and when clicked again, it will remove the product from the cart.

-   **Functional API** → The database of the application is a simple js array. The plan is to make a functional REST or GraphQL API to work with the app. As the app is simple, the API should be resolved using Javascript Vanilla or using a framework like Express.js or Nest.js (although Nest.js uses Express under the hood).
